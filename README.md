- 🌱 I’m currently completing a graphic design course at Dribbble  
  

- ❓ Ask me about anything related to SwiftUI and TCA

### Highlights

<ins>TCA</ins>
  - Applies TCA best practices
  - Modular design (Feature = Reducer + State + Actions + Effects)
  - Deep, composed reducer-hierarchy (5+ level)
  - Subscribes to Combine publishers to execute side-effects
  - Navigation tree + Navigation stack
  - Programmatic + UI navigation
  - Binding to SwiftUI views
  - Dependency injection using DependencyKey / DependencyValue
  - Exhaustive unit tests for leaf features
  - Non-exhausting unit tests for parent features
  - UT include Navigation paths and Binding reducers
  - UT shortens test time using dependency injection of mutable clock

<ins>SwiftUI</ins>
  - Fully built in SwiftUI
  - UIKit wrappers through UIViewRepresentable / UIViewControllerRepresentable
  - Custom fonts
  - Custom Views for code compactness
  - Custom animation frames implemented using timers
    
<ins>Combine</ins>
  - Set up of async data pipe to TCA features through publishers
  - Use of PassthroughSubject, ValueSubject

<ins>Swift</ins>
  - Protocols, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Generics used to organize code
  - URL requests utilized in 3 ways: completion handler, asynchronous function, Combine publishers
  - Push notifications integrated using APNs
  - Data coherence through usage of NSLock
  - Checked continuation to convert completion handlers to asynchronous functions
  - Firebase BaaS integrated and exposed through singleton pattern
  - Google Places integrated and exposted through singleton pattern
  - Custom fonts

<ins>Git</ins>
  - Feature branching strategy
  - Pull-requests
  - .gitignore
  - CI / CD
